# TAILWIND CSS PRACTICE PROJECT
This is a practice project to learn to build a full website using tailwindcss.

This is going to be the main frontend. 

Will be later deployed with django. 

Aim is to make the html files in an easy way to work with django templating Language and the structure of backend

Everything was done as per docs with some exceptions

docs: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

version: 3.1.8


## Exceptions:

### Docs Recommendation
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch

### My Version
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/css/output.css --watch

:: I have an extra css folder instead of output css being on the outside... Just incase!
